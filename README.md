# SignupPage
This project has the resources for a simple webpage containing a single form for an invitation-only ancestry-type website. The files <b>index.html</b> and <b>rules.css</b> contain the code required for the browser to render the page. The two scripts required are in the <b>js</b> directory of the project. The first script <b>jquery-3.3.1.js</b> is the JQuery library used by the second script. The second script <b>event-handlers.js</b> defines the event handlers for the form's fields.
